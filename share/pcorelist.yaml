title: corelist with subcommands and shell completion
abstract: This is a wrapper around the corelist tool which adds shell completion
description: |
  corelist is a tool providing information about when a module was included
  in the perl core, and when a feature was added to perl.

  pcorelist is a simple wrapper that adds subcommands. This makes it easier
  to add tab completion.

    pcorelist features <TAB>
